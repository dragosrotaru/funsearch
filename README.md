# Funsearch-ts

Python sucks, no homoiconicity, no first class functions. boo.

This is why I want to combine Funseach with my custom Lisp program human-ai symbiosis experiment: https://github.com/dragosrotaru/PAL.git

Where GPT is embedded as a special form in the language, and I have some other trippy shit in there.

I also have a WebGPU Implementation in TypeScript: https://github.com/dragosrotaru/ml-models.git

Network is not generalizing, WIP on the shader code.

I want to build a human-ai symbiosis workspace for programming and mathematics. I want to align the system towards adding more intelligence capabilities to itself, in order to acieve ASI.

Previously I worked at Anytype: https://anytype.io

I envision organic language and UI moulding around each individual person. Programming will become 100% speaking to AI.

As well as my futile exercise in reimagining the World Wide Web and Personal Computing in hindsight: https://github.com/dragosrotaru/hyper.git 

I want to use metacircular evaluator towers for program synthesis to fine tune a LLM on and feed into this system.

Additionally, I believe that metacircular-evaluation is the key to achieving fluid Human-AI language.
An LLM which comprehends the fundamentals of language can think in infinitely meta terms.

And I want to build a semantic scholar knowledge system trained on Arxiv to feed into it.

Decentralized Science and Force Multipliers, lets go people!

Lots more research ideas. stay tuned.
